# Getting Started with Create React App
1. Brief Architecture Diagram
The architecture of this application is built entirely in React.js on the frontend, with no backend service for now. The app provides a user management dashboard where users can be added, updated, and displayed. All data handling happens within the React components.

3. Instructions to Run the Application
To run the User Management Dashboard locally, follow the steps below:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd <your-repository-folder>
Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install the required dependencies for the frontend (React):

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Application:

After the dependencies are installed, start the app using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

3. Deployed Link
The application is deployed on Vercel. You can access the live version here:

4. Challenges Faced
Top 3 Technical Challenges:
Pagination with MUI:

The Material-UI pagination component provided was somewhat rigid, making customization difficult. Custom styling was applied using the sx prop to make the pagination more adaptable to the desired design.
Handling Data Locally:

Initially, I managed data locally within React. This required me to use mock API calls for fetching, adding, and deleting users, which posed challenges when simulating real-world behavior.
Deprecated and Outdated Packages:

Several dependencies, particularly MUI components and React versions, had been deprecated. I had to update them to their latest stable versions, which sometimes broke the build pipeline, requiring additional fixes for compatibility.


5. Logic of Implementation (In Brief)
The application implements the following logic:

User Management:

The users are stored in the component state as a simple array and are fetched, added, updated, and deleted using React’s state management.
Pagination:

The MUI Pagination component is used to display the user list in chunks. Custom styling ensures it fits well with the design.
Add New User:

A modal dialog is used to add new users. Upon filling out the form, the data is added to the state and displayed in the user table.


6. Pagination vs Scrolling
For this project, pagination was chosen for the following reasons:

Pagination is ideal for structured data where users need to navigate between chunks of information. It offers better control and can be easily styled.

Infinite Scrolling could also be implemented in the future if there's a need to display a continuous flow of data, but for now, pagination provides a cleaner and more controlled user experience.


7. Domain-Driven Design
Since this project is relatively simple and focuses mainly on frontend development, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) was not extensively implemented. However, the following components can be considered as part of the "user management" domain:

User Data:

A list of users, which includes their personal details such as name, email, and department.
Actions:

CRUD operations for user management: adding, updating, and deleting users.
This structure could evolve further by introducing additional features like role-based permissions or user groups, making the app more robust and modular in the future.

This concludes the README for the User Management Dashboard built with React.js. You can now clone, set up, and deploy your own instance, or use the live version for managing users. Let me know if you need further assistance!
