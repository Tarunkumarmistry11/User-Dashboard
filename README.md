## Features

- View a list of users in a paginated table.
- Inline editing for user details with validation.
- Save or cancel updates with an intuitive UI.
- Delete users directly from the interface.
- Modular and scalable component design.


## Technologies Used

- React.js: Component-based library for UI development.
- Material-UI: Modern styling and component library.
- CSS: For minimal custom styles.
- JavaScript (ES6): Functional programming and state management.

## Usage
- View Users: Navigate through user data displayed in a paginated table.
- Edit Users: Click on "Edit" to modify details, then save changes.
- Delete Users: Click "Delete" to remove a user permanently.
## Logic and implementation
1. State Management:

- User data is passed from UserList to UserCard as props.
- Local state tracks which row is in editing mode.
2. Event Handling:

- Editing: Controlled inputs handle live updates for name, email, and phone fields.
- Save/Cancel: Updates user state or reverts changes.
3. Reusability:
 - UserCard is designed to handle both display and editing modes dynamically.

## Pagination vs Scrolling
- Pagination:

  - Reduces DOM load by displaying data in smaller chunks.
  - Improves performance with large datasets.
  - Easier to implement with Material-UI’s built-in functionality.
  - Limitation: Customization is challenging with Material-UI's default pagination.
- Scrolling:
  - Provides a continuous and modern user experience.
  - Ideal for infinite scroll scenarios (future enhancement).
## Challenges Faced
Top 3 Technical Challenges.
1. Inbuilt Pagination Customization: 
Material-UI’s default pagination lacked flexibility, restricting UI/UX customizations.
Solution: Explore custom pagination solutions with hooks or external libraries.

2. Inaccurate or Missing Data:
Missing fields such as email or phone caused crashes during rendering.
Solution: Implement data validation and fallback default values to handle missing or invalid inputs.

3. Deprecated Dependencies:
Outdated Material-UI packages occasionally broke the deployment pipeline.
Solution: Regularly update dependencies and pin stable versions to ensure compatibility.



## Instructions to Run
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Run npm start to start the application locally.
3. To test in a production-like environment, build the project:

```bash
npm run build

```
4. Deploy to a platform like Netlify or Vercel for public access.
## Deployment

You can access the deployed version of this project here:
```bash
https://dashboard-rust-seven.vercel.app/
```


## Future Enhancements
- Backend Integration: Replace hardcoded data with a dynamic API for CRUD operations.
- Search and Filter: Add search bars and filter options to improve usability.
- Custom Pagination: Create a reusable, customizable pagination component.
- Dark Mode: Introduce a dark mode toggle for improved user experience.
